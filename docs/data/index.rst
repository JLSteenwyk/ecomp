Data Resources
==============

``data_large/``
  Real-world benchmark panels (e.g., Ascomycota, Bees, Birds).  Use these to
  reproduce the figures in the benchmarking section.  Large files are tracked in
  Git LFS or supplied separatelyâ€”check the repository README for download
  instructions.

``example_data/``
  Small toy alignments used in unit tests and quick tutorials.  Safe to commit
  and share.

``scripts/prepare_fixtures.py`` *(planned)*
  Placeholder for automated dataset downloads.  Until it lands, manage external
  datasets manually and document provenance in your benchmark reports.

When adding new datasets, include a short README describing the source,
licensing, preprocessing steps, and any accompanying trees or partitions.
