# eComp Documentation

This directory hosts the Sphinx documentation.  Common commands:

```bash
pipenv install      # install sphinx + theme
pipenv run build    # build HTML into docs/_build/html
pipenv run serve    # live-reload while editing
```

The structure mirrors the PhyKIT docs so cross-project navigation is familiar.
